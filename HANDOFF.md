## Product Position

Agent Workflow is a model-agnostic development method, structured handoff protocol, and verifiable
process contract. It isolates scarce high-value-model capacity in downstream projects by assigning
frequent bounded work to lower-cost models and reserving high-value participation for architecture,
genuine escalation, and milestone acceptance. Infrastructure development may use high-value models
freely when quality or safety benefits.

AI Memory can provide long-term/private background to an Architect or Planner. It does not override
these versioned files, and a fresh Executor must not need it when a TaskCard is complete.

## Repository and Branch Truth

- `main` / `origin/main` at `db5a45c`; PR #1 through PR #14 are merged. The documentation-only
  `codex/docs-truth-refresh` branch starts from that exact base.
- Apart from the active truth-refresh branch, there are no remaining product or evidence branches.
  All prior failure/evidence branches were converted to `archive/*` tags (events 49, 50, 73–80 plus
  prep/proof lanes). Do not delete, reset, re-point, or dispatch from archive tags; they are
  evidence, not product direction.
- A detached dirty postflight self-test worktree (`/private/tmp/agent-workflow-postflight-selftest`)
  is preserved for separate audit; do not clean it as part of unrelated work.
- Historical Agent Bus events 49–52 and 73–80 are evidence only: never read payloads, consume, ACK,
  or requeue them.

Refresh refs before relying on this snapshot.

## What Landed Since the 2026-07-18 Positioning Audit

1. **Fail-closed reviewer verdict routing (PR #12, merge `7b1bb29`).** The reviewer placeholder is
   gone. The trusted runner validates a structured `awf-review-report` block with a closed verdict set
   (`PASS` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` / `BLOCKED`), embeds the complete normalized report (≤16 KiB) in
   every verdict event, routes `decision:awf-ready` / `task:awf-rework` / `decision:awf-blocked`
   respectively, and fails the handler (no ACK) on any invalid report or failed send. Verification
   at the PR #12 head recorded 123 focused and 160 full-suite tests. See the implementation report
   for the exact event/payload contract and routing matrix.
2. **Default-locale verification boundary (PR #13, merge `f5f6a37`).** `verification_env()` strips
   `PYTHONUTF8` for trusted postflight commands only; model/tool child environments are unchanged.
   A fresh Windows Python 3.12 checkout proved the real child boundary with 4 focused tests; the
   local integration suite recorded 162 passed. Complete Windows portability remained downstream.
3. **Windows Python 3.12 UTF-8 portability closeout (PR #14, squash `db5a45c`).** Explicit
   `encoding="utf-8"` on resource reads, UTF-8-hygienic CLI test environments, and a Windows-valid
   staged secret-scan regression closed the downstream portability gate. Fresh Windows evidence:
   162 passed, 1 expected platform skip, Ruff/format/resource validation clean, trusted postflight
   passed, and push plus remote SHA verified. The accepted executor commit remains preserved at
   `archive/event-80-windows-python312-utf8-closeout-v7-success`.

## Repository Truth Consistency

Repository truth consistency is the first completion metric. Every implementation PR must update
the affected current-state sections in this file and reconcile `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` in the
same PR. Historical reviews, frozen TaskCards, and implementation reports remain point-in-time
evidence and are not rewritten when current status advances.

## Proven and Missing

Proven at deterministic-test level: exact checkout, trusted model-process and postflight gates,
allowed-path/secret/diff checks, commit/push plus remote-SHA proof, durable handler evidence,
Windows handler-return/ACK, semantic verdict validation and fail-closed routing, and Windows
Python 3.12 default-locale portability.

Missing from the complete chain: a **live cross-machine acceptance** of the semantic review loop
(fresh events, real machines, one uninterrupted dispatch → implement → review → verdict route),
recorded capacity-isolation metrics from that live run (`docs/product-metrics.md` counters have not
yet been filled), and the first non-infrastructure downstream dogfood.

## Next Gates (in order)

1. **Live cross-machine semantic-loop acceptance** — author a frozen TaskCard for a fresh, isolated
   run proving at least the `PASS` route and one failure route (`REQUEST_CHANGES` or invalid-report
   fail-closed) end to end over real Agent Bus and machines. New events and checkouts only; archive
   tags and the preserved worktree stay untouched. Record the metrics defined in
   `docs/product-metrics.md` for this run.
2. **First downstream multi-TaskCard dogfood** — a real non-infrastructure project, measuring
   high-value-model invocations per completed TaskCard against the metrics doc.

## Standing Rules

- Feature branch + PR + CI for every change; never push to `main` directly.
- Implementation and repository-truth documentation ship together; no code-first/docs-later
  closeout is complete.
- TaskCards are frozen after commit; executors touch only Allowed paths; postflight contract stays
  authoritative.
- Token values never appear in argv, logs, chat, or git.
- `Use first, abstract second`: no Agent Host, plugin SDK, generic engine, or new dependency enters
  the core from operations work.
